### The course projects can be found in Final_Assignment_Part1.pdf and Final_Assignment_Part2.pdf

This module taught the fundamentals of statistical inference. It offered a broad overview of the goals, assumptions and modes of performing statistical inference. It explained how to perform inferential tasks in highly targeted settings and use the skills developed as a roadmap for more complex inferential challenges.

The first project tasked us to compare the distribution of means of exponential variables with the normal distirbution. 

The second projected asked us to analyze the findings of a study on the effects of Vitamin C supplements on the length of odontoblast cells in Guinea Pigs.
