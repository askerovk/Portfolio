# Reproducible Research

### he course projects can be found in R.R.Assignment1.pdf and in R.R.Assignment2.pdf

This module dealt with the problem of replication and reproducibility in scientific studies. 

The first assignment tasked us to work with data taken by users of a Personal Activity Monitor (PAM), which records the number of steps taken by as given person within a 5 minute interval. We were given a list of questions to answer about the data and instructions on the way it was to be presented. 

You may find the original data here:

The second assignment tasked us to create a report in knitr package, on the impact of natural disasters in USA over the last 60 years and to identify the disaster type responsible for most casualties and highest economic damages. 

The data was take from U.S.A's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and can be found at the link below:
