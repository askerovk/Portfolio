# Getting and Cleaning Data.

### For the final solutionm please see "Final_Assignment.pdf"

This module focuses on the concept of tidy data and taugh tools for working with messy data.

The aim of the final assignment was to create a tidy dataset, based on the raw data available below:

data description - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

data source - https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The task was to combine the test and train datasets, tidy up the data and select only the mean and std measurements of the following variables:

* tBodyAcc-https://github.com/askerovk/Project_PortfolioXYZ
* tGravityAcc-XYZ
* tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
* tBodyGyro-XYZ
* tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
* tBodyAccMag
* tGravityAccMag
* tBodyAccJerkMag
* tBodyGyroMag
* tBodyGyroJerkMag
* fBodyAcc-XYZ
* fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
* fBodyGyro-XYZ
* fBodyAccMag
* fBodyAccJerkMag
* fBodyGyroMag
* fBodyGyroJerkMag

Next, we were tasked to create a new tidy dataset, which displayed the mean values of the mean and std observations per subject (experiment participant), activity and variable. 

The submission was to take the form of a README.md (current file) describing the task and data, "Codebook.md" which describes the variables in the tidy data set and Run_Analysis.R which showed the code used to create the tidy data set.
