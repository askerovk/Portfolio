### Summary
This is a google sheets program, designed to facilitate equal workload distribution, by assigning each task within the process pipeline to a given member of the team.  

This project was originally developed by me while working in the Customer Service Division of Booking.com and I had led its implementation at every stage of the production process:


1.	Studying the workflow process and identifying the largest bottleneck.
2.	Assessing available resources and acquiring basic programming knowledge. 
3.	Designing the program concept and writing the first software draft. 
4.	Going through the feedback â€“ redesign loop with my own team.
5.	Introducing the concept to the other teams in Shanghai and Tokyo offices. 
10. Incorporating their suggestions into the program. 
6.	Coordinating a smooth transition from the old program to the new.
7.	Writing a user manual, adding requested secondary features. 
8.	Working to simplify the software code, to make admin tasks easier.
9.	Writing a comprehensive admin manual and training two of my colleagues to be program admins.

The version of the original software presented here has all proprietary information removed.
