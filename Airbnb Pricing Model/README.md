## Pricing model of Airbnb properties in Berlin.

This is a minor personal project, which I undertook to practice tuning linear regression models. The model in question attempts to predict the price of a property listed on Airbnb.com. based on secondary factors, such as location, property type and etc.

The project report in PDF format and a reproducible R markdown document are available above.
